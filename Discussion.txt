================== PSEUDO-CODE =====================

Initialize the shared memory array {
    create 5 shared memory sections, each containing a number.
    get pointers to each of the shared memory sections and put them in an array.
    assign semaphores to each of the individual sections.
    claim all semaphore locks, and populate the shared memory segments with
        provided values.
    release the locks so that child processes can claim them as soon as they 
        start running.
}

Spawn four worker processes {
    fork() four child processes
    add 1 to the number of active children, stored in a separate semaphore.
    assign two numbers (from shared memory) to each process, these are what
        they are responsible for sorting
}

Children -------------------
Worker processes continually check their numbers {
    if the numbers are out of order {
        claim the locks on those numbers.
        swap the numbers.
        release the locks on those numbers.
    }
}
---------------------------

Parent Process =======================
Parent process waits untill all children finish working and the array is sorted {
        tell the child processes to stop
        print out the sorted array, as well as its min, max, and mean.
    }
}
======================================


This program sorts the array of 5 given numbers in non-increasing order. 
It is in essence a variation on the dining philosophers problem; implementing
a bubblesort using concurrent processes. In this case the processes
cannot deadlock because the dependencies are not circular, and the ends are only accessed
by a single member, but our solution is extensible for longer number arrays
and would work if the arrays had any number of dependencies. If you did not want to
write an extensible solution you only need locks/semaphores for the elements that are
accessed by more than one member; in this case the three middle elements.

Our solution ensures mutual exclusion with all elements using one semaphore per array element,
and uses one final semaphore for use as a control to ensure the main process does not 
prematurely terminate the children doing the sorting.

--------------- DISCUSSION ------------------------

For all of the test cases in sampleArrays.h, the program executes correctly in
sorting the supplied arrays in non-ascending order. It has also worked for every
instance of user-supplied numbers.
