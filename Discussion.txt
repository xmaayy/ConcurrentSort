This program sorts the array of 5 given characters in descending 
(non-increasing) order. It is in essence a variation on the dining philosophers
problem, implementing a bubblesort using concurrent processes.
What follows is pseudocode describing the sorting algorithm:

Initialize the shared memory array {
    create 5 shared memory sections, each containing a number.
    get pointers to each of the shared memory sections and put them in an array.
    assign semaphores to each of the individual sections.
    claim all semaphore locks, and populate the shared memory segments with
        provided values.
    release the locks so that child processes can claim them as soon as they 
        start running.
}

Spawn four worker processes {
    fork() four times.
    add 1 to the number of active children, stored in a separate semaphore.
    assign two numbers (in shared memory) to each process.
}

Worker processes continually check their numbers {
    if the numbers are out of order {
        claim the locks on those numbers.
        swap the numbers.
        release the locks on those numbers.
    }
}

Parent process waits untill all children finish working {
    if the number of working children is zero OR the array is sorted {
        kill all the child processes.
        print out the sorted array, as well as its min, max, and mean.
    }
}
